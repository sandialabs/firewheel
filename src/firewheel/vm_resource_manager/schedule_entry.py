class ScheduleEntry:
    """
    This class is the base class for all types of schedule entries.
    It is in this class that all necessary instance variables are declared.
    It is important that all variables within the :py:class:`base_objects.ScheduleEntry`
    be instance variables, as opposed to class variables. This is because a VM's schedule
    (i.e. :py:class:`base_objects.VmResourceSchedule`, which contains a list of
    :py:class:`base_objects.ScheduleEntry` objects) is serialized via :py:mod:`pickle` and
    passed to the :ref:`vm-resource-handler`.
    Only instance variables get preserved through the :py:mod:`pickle` process.

    Schedule entries have a set of general instance variables.
    The type of schedule entry determines which variables are required.
    The only variable that all ScheduleEntries require is ``start_time``.
    This class is not intended to be used directly, but through its
    subclasses.
