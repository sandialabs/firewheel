class ExperimentGraphDecorable:
    """
    A per-instance decorable object. This permits the attributes and interface
    to change for instances of this object, with the changes limited to the
    particular instance that is "decorated".

    Because this affects the instance level, there are some limitations:

    - Class methods and attributes in the decorator become instance methods
      and attributes (respectively) in the decorated instance.
    - Method descriptors are supported, with the caveat that they are reduced
      to basic methods. That is, the method descriptor's ``__get__`` function is
      called with the merged instance, and the result becomes an instance
      method.
    - Descriptors (and properties) are handled as class attributes.
      This breaks the "descriptor-ness" of the attributes--lookups simply return
      the actual descriptor object.
    - Using a descriptor with any method in the
      :py:attr:`skip_set <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.ExperimentGraphDecorable.skip_set>`
      may not function as expected.

    Note:
        Some common methods such as ``__eq__`` are actually class methods. This
        results in decorators being unable to affect operators such as ``==``.

    Names in the decorator and decoratee instance may conflict. If these occur
    at the class-level in the decorator, these conflicts may be resolved by
    providing the decorate function with a ``conflict_handler``. This is a
    callable taking 3 positional arguments: ``entry_name``, ``decorator_value``,
    ``current_instance_value``, where the values are the values of the attribute
    at ``entry_name``. The callable must return the value for the merged attribute
    if the conflict handler found an appropriate way to deconflict, otherwise
    it should raise an :py:exc:`IncorrectConflictHandlerError`, signaling that
    another conflict handler was likely intended to be used for the given
    attribute.

    The merge process also ignores some built-in attributes by name to avoid
    always causing merge conflicts. Specifically, these are defined in
    :py:attr:`skip_set <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.ExperimentGraphDecorable.skip_set>`.

    Note:
        Notably, the only built-in methods which we expect users to modify are
        ``__str__`` and ``__repr__``. Any modification of other built-in types
        (e.g., ``__hash__`` or ``__eq__``) may not function as expected.


    Finally, once the methods/attributes have been merged into the instance, the
    decorator's ``__init__`` method is called. This method is given the merged
    instance, so any values the decorator expects to initialize should behave
    normally from the perspective of the decorator's code. Arguments for the
    decorator's ``__init__`` may be passed to the decorate function, with positional
    arguments as a list to the init_args keyword and keyword arguments as a
    dictionary to the ``init_kwargs`` keyword.

    The behaviors outlined here are expected to combine to allow decorators to
    be implemented as a normal class.

    Examples:
        **Merging Example**

        Current instance defines ``common_method`` as (this could be in some
        already-applied decorator):

        .. code-block:: python

            class Foo:
                def common_method(self):
                    return 42

        and the decorator being applied defines ``common_method`` as:

        .. code-block:: python

            class Bar:
                def common_method(self):
                    return 50

        If we want the merge to use ``Bar``'s definition of ``common_method`` over any
        other definition (as a way to simulate inheritance) we could provide
        the following function as the value of ``conflict_handler``:

        .. code-block:: python

            def handle_conflict(entry_name, decorator_value, instance_value):
                if entry_name == 'common_method':
                    return Bar.common_method
                raise IncorrectConflictHandlerError
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize an empty list of decorators and also a list of methods
        to skip.

        Attributes:
            decorators (set): A set of decorators (initially empty).
            skip_set (set): A set of methods to skip/ignore.
                Entries are in this list for various reasons. All are "built-ins" in
                Python classes. None are of type ``types.BuiltinMethodType``, since we can
                skip those more generically. Some are dictionaries, others are type
                ``type``, and some are ``method_descriptor``'s. A ``method_descriptor``
                defines some object that is not implemented in Python source (e.g.,
                it is in C). We do not want to skip all of these, because we may
                actually want to merge some objects that are implemented in C (so we
                put them in the skip list by name instead). Reference:
                https://stackoverflow.com/q/15512183.
                There are also ``wrapper_descriptor``'s, with similar reasoning to
                ``method_descriptors``.
                Primarily, this list includes most built-in methods that FIREWHEEL
                users are unlikely to use and, therefore, can be ignored as they
                will always be left alone. By ignoring these built-in methods
                we can greatly improve performance of decorating a :py:class:`Vertex`.
                Notably, the only built-in methods which we expect users to modify
                are ``__str__`` and ``__repr__``.

                https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html
            cached_self_dir (set): A set of methods/attributes for the current object.
                by initializing this set in the ``__init__`` function and then adding
                to it with each decoration, we can reduce the number of calls to
                :py:func:`dir`, which is an expensive operation.

        Each graph :py:class:`Vertex` and :py:class:`Edge` are a layered stack of
        Python objects where each layer is a python decorator.
        Class functions can then be called on
        all the objects. Using this methodology, model component objects can be
        mixed and matched to create the desired :py:class:`Vertex`/:py:class:`Edge`.
        This creates an easy way to build complicated experiments with modular code.
        Decoration can be used to:

        * Provide specific :py:class:`Vertex`/:py:class:`Edge` functions.
        * Specify images or VM Resources
        * Leverage software/configuration available in other Model Components.

        Here is an example of a potential model component object stack::

            Vertex("host.acme.com")
            |
            -> VMEndpoint()
            |   - run_executable()
            |   - drop_file()
            |   - connect()
            |
            --> LinuxHost()
            |    - configure_ips()
            |    - set_hostname()
            |
            ---> UbuntuHost()
            |     - install_debs()
            |
            ----> Ubuntu1604Server()

        The :py:class:`Vertex` starts with only a name, but as it is decorated by various other
        objects, it gains new properties and methods which can be leveraged.

        There are two ways to build up this model component object stack. You
        can use explicit decoration, in which all components are added explicitly,
        as shown below::

            server = Vertex("host.acme.com")
            server.decorate(VMEndpoint)
            server.decorate(LinuxHost)
            server.decorate(UbuntuHost)
            server.decorate(Ubuntu1604Server)

        Alternatively, you can use dependency decoration and only call decorate
        on the last object in the stack (assuming it uses ``@require_class`` on the
        previous layers)::

            server = Vertex("host.acme.com")
            server.decorate(Ubuntu1604Server)

        The decorate method is necessary to decorate graph :py:class:`Vertices <Vertex>` or
        :py:class:`Edges <Edge>` with additional model component objects.
        It is important to note that we make
        class attributes into instance attributes (as the general case for data
        and functions). This could impact behavior, especially for assumptions
        with respect to class data attributes.

        Additionally, we expect that users will **NOT** modify most built-in methods
        which were defined in the
        :py:attr:`skip_set <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.ExperimentGraphDecorable.skip_set>`.
        We only assume that users have potentially modified ``__str__`` and ``__repr__``.
        If either of these methods has been modified (e.g. not equal to the
        default :py:class:`object` implementation, then we will need a conflict handler.

        Note:
            We are using :py:func:`getattr` rather than :py:func:`inspect.getattr_static`.
            If a MC Object sets either ``__str__`` or ``__repr__``
            using Python descriptors, that code will be executed and may differ.
            This decision was made because 1) The chances of using descriptor to set
            one of these methods is rare when creating a FIREWHEEL Model Component Object
            and 2) :py:func:`getattr` is significantly faster than
            :py:func:`inspect.getattr_static`.
            The performance hit from using :py:mod:`inspect` is dramatic when you consider each
            :py:class:`Vertex` may be decorated numerous times and there may be thousands of
            :py:class:`Vertices <Vertex>`/:py:class:`Edges <Edge>` in the graph.

            Here is a :py:mod:`timeit` comparison:

            >>> import timeit
            >>> timeit.timeit("getattr(object, '__str__')")
            0.1993947122246027
            >>> timeit.timeit("inspect.getattr_static(object, '__str__')", setup="import inspect")
            3.008564186282456

        This method also uses a module-level dictionary of all the MC objects
        and their methods/attributes
        (:py:data:`CACHED_DECORATOR_OBJECTS
        <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.CACHED_DECORATOR_OBJECTS>`).
        This is a performance improvement as :py:func:`dir()` is an expensive
        operation and will no longer need to be called for each instance of the same object.
        This will only have minor memory impacts as most experiments use only a handful
        of different MC Objects types.
