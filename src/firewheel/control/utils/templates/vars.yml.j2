# This is the variables file for installing {{ mc_name }}.
# These variables will be used by ``tasks.yml`` to perform one-time actions which help prepare the
# model component for use. Common uses include downloading VM Resources from the Internet.
# 
# FIREWHEEL will automatically provide the following variables to the Ansible playbooks:
# - ``mc_name`` -- The name of the Model Component.
# - ``mc_dir`` -- The full path to the model component directory.
#
# In addition to any variables the specific tasks need, the ``vars.yml`` *should* have a
# ``required_files`` key where a list of the final output files is listed.
# This is because FIREWHEEL supports caching pre-computed blobs from various resources to
# enable offline experiment access. The process of collecting (offline) required files is automatically
# handled by FIREWHEEL and using this process is discussed in detail in the documentation.
# These required files should be defined here and the model component installation is assumed
# to be complete when all ``required_files`` are present.
# If no ``required_files`` are needed, then it can be omitted from ``INSTALL/vars.yml``.
#
# NOTE: It is imperative that specific versions of software are used.
# Without being as specific as possible, experimental results will **NOT** be repeatable.
# We strongly recommend that any changes to software versions are accompanied by a warning and a
# new model component version.
